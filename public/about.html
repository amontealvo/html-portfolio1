<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>One of my favorite quotes that I keep very dear to me is from the Movie, "Kung Fu Panda" when Ugwe says to Po,
"Yesterday is History, 
 Tomorrow is a Mystery,
 But today is a gift.
 That is why it is called the 'present.'"
 As I always trap myself from yesterday from either being good or bad, I tend to keep on going with the flow as time goes by and let tomorrow surprise me with what mysteries
 are ahead of me. Yet, I have to remember what I have today to keep my chin up. I have my family, friends, and a loving supporting wife that I will go to hell and back for.

<p>At this time, I'm stuck with career choices, but I do want to widen my ability to work with whatever makes me happy and wake up in the morning and get excited to go to work.
  I enjoy learning about any type of technology I can get my hands on and understanding how to use it and maybe even fix it. I also understand the coding behind it and what makes it work.
  With technology and AI advancing, I also want to understand more about what people think of it and their point of view.
